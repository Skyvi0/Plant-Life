Do you have plants? If you do, you could give our little web app a try it was developed in two weeks with mobile-first in mind, so it might look a bit funky on a laptop. Our main feature is that you add a garden, the place where you add your plants by taking a picture and automatically getting the name of the plant and anything you need to know to take care of your little buddy. I would love to get some feedback, thanks for your time.
